# Introduction
### The Challenge: Multi-City Prediction
The challenge takes place in 4 metropolitan areas (cities A, B, C, D), somewhere in Japan. Each area is divided into 500 meters x 500 meters cells, which span a 200 x 200 grid. The human mobility datasets contain the movement of individuals across a 75-day period, discretized into 30-minute intervals and 500-meter grid cells (see Figure below).

The task is to predict the movement of a subset of individuals in cities A, B, C, and D, during days 61 to 75 (orange colored parts), using movement data of individuals in cities A, B, C, D (from day 1 to 60) (blue colored parts), as shown in the following Figure.

Not all cities’ data are required to be used for prediction. For instance, to predict city B’s movement from days 61 to 75, one can just use the movement patterns in city B between 1 to 60 (bold arrow). Using data from other cities (e.g., city A) may or may not improve the prediction accuracy!

### Evaluation Metrics
The predicted human movement trajectories will be evaluated against the actual trajectories and the accuracy using the GEO-BLEU metric (Shimizu et al., 2022). Python implementations of the evaluation metrics will be provided on LY Corporation’s GitHub page (https://github.com/yahoojapan/geobleu).
The hyperparameters used for the GEO-BLEU scores are: Beta=0.5, n=5.

### Baseline Results
The organizers have implemented the following baseline methods and tested their prediction accuracy. Evaluation results of baseline methods applied to the test split containing 3,000 user IDs:
- Global Mean: Calculate the "global mean" as the average of staypoints in days 1 to 60 of all users' trajectories, and for days 61 to 75, predict the trajectory as if the user continues to stay at that point.
- Global Mode: Determine the "global mode" as the most frequent staypoint in days 1 to 60 of all users' trajectories, and for days 61 to 75, predict the trajectory as if the user continues to stay at that point.
- Per-User Mean: Calculate the "per-user mean" as the average of staypoints in days 1 to 60 of a given user's trajectory, and for days 61 to 75, predict the trajectory as if the user continues to stay at that point.
- Per-User Mode: Determine the "per-user mode" as the most frequent staypoint in days 1 to 60 of a given user's trajectory, and for days 61 to 75, predict the trajectory as if the user continues to stay at that point.
- Unigram Model: For a given user, create a unigram model of staypoints from days 1 to 60 of their trajectory, and use it to predict the trajectory in days 61 to 75.
- Bigram Model: For a given user, create a bigram model of staypoints from days 1 to 60 of their trajectory, and use it to predict the trajectory in days 61 to 75.
- Bigram Model (top_p=0.7): For a given user, create a bigram model of staypoints from days 1 to 60 of their trajectory, and use it to predict the trajectory in days 61 to 75, applying a sampling parameter of top_p=0.7.

### Dataset
The data challenge participants are provided with human mobility patterns of 4 metropolitan areas.

This data contains synthetic movement information generated from user location data obtained from LY Corporation smartphone applications. It does not reveal the actual timestamp, latitude, longitude, etc., and does not identify individuals.

The task is to predict the movement of 3000 individuals each in cities A, B, C, and D, during days 61 to 75, using movement data of individuals in cities A, B, C, D, which includes a total of 150,000, 30,000, 25,000, and 20,000 individuals, respectively. The locations (x,y) that need to be predicted are masked with cell numbers ‘999’.

For cities A and B, days 61 to 75 are directly after days 1 to 60, but for cities C and D, days 61 to 75 are several months later than the days 1 to 60 and are not consecutive.
