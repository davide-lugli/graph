city_TB: test set of first 10.000 users extracted from city_A

Iperparameters:
run_city(
  n2v_dim=64,
  n2v_walk_length=20,
  n2v_num_walks=10,
  n2v_window=10,
  n2v_workers=4,
  n2v_p=1.0,
  n2v_q=1.0,
  n2v_mode="SparseOTF",
  n2v_directed=True,
  n2v_extend=False,
  topN_user=200,
  topM_ctx=200
)

Prediction strategy:
1. Prototype similarity where candidates are:
  - Top N frequented cells for that user
  - Top M popular cells for that context
2. Most frequent cell for user
3. Most popular cell for context
