city_TA: test set of first 10.000 users extracted from city_A

Iperparameters:
run_city(
  n2v_dim=64, 
  n2v_walk_length=20, 
  n2v_num_walks=10, 
  n2v_window=10, 
  n2v_workers=4, 
  n2v_p=1.0,
  n2v_q=2.0,
  n2v_mode="SparseOTF",
  n2v_directed=True,
  n2v_extend=False,
  topN_user=100, 
  topM_ctx=100,
  topK_trans=30
)

Prediction strategy:
1. Prototype similarity where candidates are:
  - Top N frequent cells for that user
  - Top M popular cells for that context
  - Top K transitions from previous cell
2. Top transition from cell
3. Most frequent cell for user
4. Most popular cell for context
